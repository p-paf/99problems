# 99problems
Solving 99 problems in Haskell for PPAF lectures.

## Submitting code
1. Create a github account, if you don't already have one
2. Fork this repository to your account, we'll called the fork repository as your remote repo
3. Clone your remote repo to your computer, we'll call this the local repo
4. Solve problems, make changes and then commit them to the local repo
5. Push changes from local repo to your remote repo
6. Make a Pull Request (PR) from your remote repo to this remote repo
7. Wait for it to be merged.
8. And, Voila! You successfully submitted your code

## Writing code
1. Open you local Create a new directory with your name/nick (whichever you prefer)
2. Create a file with the same name as the problem, for e.g. `Problem1.hs` for problem 1
3. The solution must be a function that has the same name and behaviour as given in the problem description, for e.g. in [problem 1](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/1_to_10) `myLast`
4. You can implement the the solution in multiple ways, try to include as many as you can in the solution file, each adding ' to the end of the name, for e.g. `myLast` and `myLast'`
5. Add 3 test cases in the solution file that demonstrate some behaviour the solution
6. Submit your code with the instructions given above
